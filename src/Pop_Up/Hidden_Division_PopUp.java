// POP UPS
//Popups are small or separate window which will be displayed when we perform action on any components present in a webpage.
//These popups can be handled by selenium directly, but sometimes we may need to use 3rd party tools to handle these popups.

//Types of popups:
//1. Hidden-Division Popup
//2. Alert popup
//3. Child browser Popup
//4. Authentication Popup
//S. File Upload Popup
//6. File Download Popup

//1. Hidden-Division Popup
//This popup is part of website (colorful window).
//This popup have DOM structure.
//So we can handle this popup by creating web Element and perform actions on those web Elements.
//When this popup disappear HTML code related with popup will disappear.
//We can inspect the elements present in pop up.
//As we can Inspect element present in popup then using selenium we can handle it & no need to switch.
